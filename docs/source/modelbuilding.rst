Tools for Model Building and Good Practices
*******************************************

This section discusses the specific tools for recommended for common statistical tasks. In addition, the document identifies requirements that the tools need to meet regarding documentation, testing, deployment and other current short comings that will become goals/deliverables for the (ATLAS) statistics forum.

Good Practices
==============

Good practices in model building
--------------------------------
- control and validation regions [ Exo ]

Modeling systematics - Correlations
-----------------------------------
- Correlation modeling (prior and observed) [ Exo, Guide, some new material needed ]

Modeling systematic uncertainties - shape vs rate
-------------------------------------------------
[ Exo, WV slides ]

Modeling systematics - 2point discussion
----------------------------------------
[ Guide to PLL but needs updating ]

Modeling systematcs - pruning and smoothing
-------------------------------------------
[ Exo ]

Modeling systematics - DOF
--------------------------
how many DOFs does your conceptual systematic have? [ Guide to PLL ]
