Good Practices
==============

Modeling systematics
--------------------
 - Uncerstanding constrained NPs - associated tool - ranking plots [ PLL, Exo, Slides ]

Recommendations for measurements
--------------------------------
(as opposed to limits)

Bayesian misc
-------------
 - marginalisation tools etc, choice of prior, sampling techniques etc [ Kyles notes? ]

Tables of systematics
---------------------
 - how to do this, conceptual issues with NP correlations between reported groups [ Exo, Slides, PLL ]

Blinding
========

expected vs observed
--------------------
